## About
PrimeRadiant is a powerful framework for simulating and testing hypotheses about populations described by demographic, socio-economic, and behavioral attributes. It leverages real or simulated data to generate dynamic populations, allowing users to explore relationships, dependencies, and patterns across various characteristics such as age, gender, residence, education, employment, political affiliation, and more.

With PrimeRadiant, researchers, data scientists, and developers can:

    Model complex population dynamics.
    Test "what-if" scenarios and hypotheses.
    Visualize distributions and correlations across attributes.
    Integrate custom rules, dependencies, and external datasets.

Designed for flexibility and extensibility, PrimeRadiant empowers users to gain insights into how populations evolve and respond under varying conditions, making it a versatile tool for academic research, policy analysis, and predictive modeling.
