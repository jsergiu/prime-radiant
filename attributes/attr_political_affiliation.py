Key Influencing Factors for Extremism

Age:
    Younger individuals (18â€“35) are more likely to align with extremist ideologies, often due to dissatisfaction with the status quo.
Residence:
    Rural areas may lean toward extremism due to economic hardship and less access to diverse political discourse.
Income:
    Low-income individuals are more likely to feel disenfranchised and gravitate toward extremist views.
Education:
    Lower education levels correlate with susceptibility to extremist rhetoric.
Global Trends:
    Current studies suggest that ~20% of Romanians support extremist ideologies (far-right or far-left).
